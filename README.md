# Trigger-Word-Detection-TensorFLow


Welcome ! 
In this assignment, I will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wake word detection). 

* Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  
* For this exercise, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound. 
* By the end of this assignment, you will be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."

To participate on this project, you need to know how to :
- Structure a speech recognition project
- Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
- Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
